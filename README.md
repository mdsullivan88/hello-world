Hello World

'What is experience? What is life? What is motion? What is reality? To all such questions we must give St. Augustine's answer to the question, "What is time?"--"I know, but when you ask me I don't." Experience, life, motion, and reality are so many noises used to symbolize the sum of sensations, thoughts, feelings, and desires. And if you ask, "What are sensations, et cetera?" I can only answer, "Don't be silly. You know very well what they are. We can't go on defining things indefinitely without going round in circles. To define means to fix, and, when you get down to it, real life isn't fixed."'
